Networking
===============

This is some example code for using sockets in python in the future for this project. It is mostly just messing around with networking.

Server/Client
---------------------

First run the server so it can start listening, then run the client so it can send its message

Run Server:

    python ./server.py

Run Client:

    python client.py
